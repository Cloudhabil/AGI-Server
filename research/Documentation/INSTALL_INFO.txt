  • H-Net hierarchical memory management
  • Dynamic chunking for long-term context
  • Web-based frontend interface
  • File association support for drag-and-drop operations

2. "Cannot connect to bus" errors
   → Verify BUS_TOKEN is set correctly
   → Ensure Redis is running (if configured)

3. "Model endpoint unreachable"
   → Check configs/models.yaml settings
   → Verify Ollama or LLM service is running
   → Test endpoints with: CloudHabil.exe doctor

4. File association not working
   → Re-register the association in Windows
   → Check file_association_log.txt for errors
