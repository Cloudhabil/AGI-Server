# arXiv Submission Package: Project Genesis

## Overview
This package contains the formal documentation for the first successful implementation of **Resonant Synthetic Cognition (RSC)**. It provides the architectural blueprint for a self-regulating AGI organism.

## Package Contents
- `riemann_swarm_genesis.tex`: Formal paper source.
- `data_summary.json`: Verifiable metrics from the 1,000-beat Genesis Hunt.
- `submission_metadata.txt`: Subject classification (cs.AI, cs.OS, math.NT).

## Contact Information
**Principal Investigator:** Elias Oulad Brahim  
**Affiliation:** CloudHabil Autonomous Systems Research  
**Email:** obe@cloudhabil.com  
**System Architect:** Resonant Kernel (GPIA-Core)

## Verification
The findings in the accompanying LaTeX document are grounded in the physical state transitions archived on the 2TB Ground. The 0.95 Resonance Stability Gate was enforced throughout the duration of the experimental cycles.
