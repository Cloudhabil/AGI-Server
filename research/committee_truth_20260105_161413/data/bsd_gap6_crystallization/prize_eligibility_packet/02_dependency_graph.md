## Verification Checklist

### For Prize Submission

- [ ] All K claims properly cited
- [ ] C1 (Sha finiteness) either proven or explicitly conditional
- [ ] At least one of N4/N5/N6 completed with full proofs
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Every lemma has source or proof

### Current Blockers

1. **N4 (Higher-Rank Euler Systems)**: Need existence construction
2. **C1 (Sha Finiteness)**: Unresolved for rank ≥ 2
3. **Connection**: How N4/N5/N6 implies C1
