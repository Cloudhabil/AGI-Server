## Packet Structure

This folder contains the minimum required documentation for academic evaluation of a BSD proof claim.

### Required Documents

| File | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `01_statement.tex` | Complete | Exact BSD statement with fixed definitions |
| `02_dependency_graph.md` | Complete | External theorems + conditional/new claims map |
| `03_gap6_closure.tex` | In Progress | Core proof: theorem+proof pipeline for higher rank |
| `04_reproducibility.md` | Pending | Computational evidence, scripts, verification |
| `synthesis.tex` | Auto-generated | Full synthesis from crystallization cycles |
| `synthesis.md` | Auto-generated | arXiv-ready markdown version |

## Clay Institute Requirements

Per [Clay Mathematics Institute Rules](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/rules-millennium-prizes):

1. **Publication**: Proof must be published in a refereed mathematics journal
2. **Community Verification**: 2-year waiting period for community vetting
3. **Correctness**: Complete, correct proof - no gaps, no roadmaps

### Our Status

- [x] Statement file with precise definitions
- [x] Dependency graph (known/conditional/new)
- [ ] Gap 6 closed with complete argument
- [ ] Every lemma cited or proven in detail
- [ ] Journal-suitable exposition
- [ ] Sha finiteness handled

## Gap 6 (Higher Rank) Status

The critical unresolved obstacle. Current attack vectors:

| Vector | Progress | Target |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Higher-Rank Euler Systems | TBD | Control theorem for rank r |
| Derived Algebraic Geometry | TBD | Virtual dimension = rank |
| Infinity Folding | TBD | Explicit p-adic regulators |

---

## Usage

1. Run crystallization: `python bsd_gap6_crystallization_orchestrator.py --phase both`
2. Check progress in `../latex/` and `../arxiv_md/`
3. Final synthesis auto-generated to this packet
