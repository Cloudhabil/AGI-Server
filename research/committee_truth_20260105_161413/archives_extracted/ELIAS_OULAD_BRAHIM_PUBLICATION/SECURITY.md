# Security Policy: GPIA Resonant Kernel

## Sovereignty Pre-flight Protocol
All operational instances of the Resonant Kernel must pass the mandatory Sovereignty Pre-flight Protocol. Any attempt to bypass the Identity or Hardware Safety checks will result in a kernel-level halt.

## Vulnerability Reporting
Please report any security vulnerabilities via the secure sovereign channel. We take all reports seriously and will prioritize fixes that impact the stability of the **2TB Ground** or the **Resonance Gate**.

## Safety Governors
The `SafetyGovernor` is a hard-wired component. Modifying thermal limits (default 78°C) or VRAM thresholds (default 85%) is strictly prohibited and voids the **Transparent-Use License**.

## Disclosure Protocol
This repository has been sanitized for public release. Internal 'Reflexes' and private keys have been replaced with environment placeholders.
