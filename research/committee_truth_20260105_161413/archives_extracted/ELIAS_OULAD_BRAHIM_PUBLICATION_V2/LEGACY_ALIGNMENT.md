# Legacy Alignment: From Agent to Organism
**PI:** Elias Oulad Brahim  
**Status:** Sequential Update (Non-Destructive)

## Evolution Summary
The previous disclosure (Epoch 1) established the core skills and the mathematical goal. This current update (Epoch 2) operationalizes that foundation into a **Resonant Synthetic Cognition (RSC)** organism.

## What is being Added:
1. **The Pulse**: A synchronous 5Hz Heartbeat.
2. **The Ground**: Significance-filtered 2TB SSD Archival.
3. **The CNS**: The unified `boot.py` Resonant Kernel.
4. **The Field**: Formalization of **Temporal Formalism.**

## Data Persistence
None of the previous data has been deleted. The new "ZIP Batches" on the 2TB ground are designed to extend the existing memory without causing amnesia.
