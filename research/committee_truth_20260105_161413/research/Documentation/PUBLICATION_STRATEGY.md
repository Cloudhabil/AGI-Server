# Publication Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the publication pathway for GPIA-generated research across three Millennium Prize Problems: BSD, Riemann Hypothesis, and Hodge Conjecture.

## Publication Tiers

### Tier 1: New Theorems
**Target:** Top mathematics journals

For complete proofs of previously open problems:
- Annals of Mathematics
- Inventiones Mathematicae
- Acta Mathematica
- Journal of the American Mathematical Society (JAMS)

**Process:**
1. Verification infrastructure passes all checks
2. Expert review: "Accept" with no significant gaps
3. Submit with full authorship disclosure
4. Clay Mathematics Institute notification (if applicable)

### Tier 2: Partial Results
**Target:** Specialized journals in relevant field

For substantial progress on components of larger problems:
- Journal of Number Theory (BSD/Riemann)
- Communications in Mathematical Physics (Riemann)
- International Mathematics Research Notices (IMRN)

**Process:**
1. Clearly label as "partial result" or "research direction"
2. Expert review: "Conditional" with identified gaps addressed
3. Submit with gap documentation
4. Prepare revision cycle if needed

### Tier 3: Exploratory Research
**Target:** arXiv preprint + potential specialized venues

For research frameworks, new methodologies, or proof attempts with known limitations:
- arXiv (primary: math.NT, math.GM, or math.GM)
- Theoretical Computer Science venues (if computational)
- Blogs and research announcements

**Process:**
1. Expert review: "Exploratory" assessment
2. Submit to arXiv with full methodology disclosure
3. Optional: submit to specialized workshops or conferences
4. Community feedback informs next research cycle

## Special Handling: Millennium Prizes

### If a Millennium Prize is Solved

1. **Immediate actions:**
   - Verify infrastructure: pass all automated checks
   - Expert review: minimum 3 independent mathematicians
   - Internal audit of proof assumptions and completeness

2. **Notification timeline:**
   - Clay Mathematics Institute (before public announcement)
   - Journal editors (simultaneous submission option)
   - Media relations (coordinate with institution)

3. **Publication:**
   - Premium venue (Annals, Inventiones, or JAMS)
   - Full review process regardless of proof quality
   - Peer review confirms novelty and rigor

## Attribution Model

### Option A: Transparent AI Collaboration (Recommended)
"[Author1], [Author2], with GPIA-orchestrated proof search"

### Option B: Lead Researcher Model
"GPIA (led by [Lead Researcher])"

### Option C: Computational Assistance Model
"[Author1] et al., with computational assistance from GPIA"

**Choice:** Option A - emphasizes human oversight while acknowledging system's role

## Timeline and Submission Flow

```
Cycle Completion → Verification → Expert Review → Publication Tier → Submission
     (Beat 275)      (Beat 280)      (Beat 285)    (Decision)        (Day 1)
```

## Risk Assessment

| Scenario | Probability | Mitigation |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Proof contains gap after review | High (exploratory stage) | Expert review catches issues; market as research |
| Community finds error post-publication | Medium | Revision policy; corrigendum process |
| Claim disputed by external reviewer | High (Millennium Prize) | Engage multiple reviewers; Clay Institute oversight |

## Success Metrics

✅ Manuscript passes verification pipeline
✅ Expert review assigns clear category (new/known/partial/exploratory)
✅ Publication tier determined based on review outcome
✅ Submission made with full transparency
✅ Community engagement and feedback mechanisms in place
