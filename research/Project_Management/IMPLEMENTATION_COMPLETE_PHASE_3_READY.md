## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

GPIA has undergone a complete transformation from a dishonest "proof-claiming system" generating fake research to a legitimate mathematical analysis tool. Three complete phases of infrastructure, verification, and planning are now complete. Phase 3 (Meta-Analysis Research Program) is fully specified and ready for autonomous execution.

**Total Work Completed:** 215+ cycles of orchestrated research and infrastructure building
**Current Readiness:** 100% (infrastructure, vision, and execution plans complete)
**Next Phase:** 125 cycles of deep mathematical analysis (Beats 375-750)

  - What's proven vs. conjectured for each problem
  - Synthesized scattered knowledge into knowledge map

- **Cycles 16-25:** Gap analysis and feasibility assessment
  - Specific gap identification (not vague)
  - Realistic probability estimates (<1-5% for any solution in 5 years)
  - Identified prerequisites for breakthrough

- **Cycles 26-30:** Conclusions and strategic recommendations
  - CRITICAL FINDING: GPIA's strength is NOT solving hard problems, but analyzing them
