 The BSD conjecture relates the rank of an elliptic curve E to the growth rate of its L-functions at s=1, as indicated by the formula:
ord_s(L(E, s)) = rank(E).
To verify this conjecture for a particular elliptic curve, one needs a comparison morphism phi that connects the algebraic side (determinant of Selmer complex) and the analytic side (L-function at 1+t). 
This comparison morphism can be represented by an adelic determinant line L_A(E), which contains all arithmetic information, along with a torsion regulators on the algebraic side, and a rational number on the analytic side. The BSD conjecture becomes:
phi = tau_an o tau_alg^{-1} equals the constants in the BSD formula, where phi is a comparison morphism between the algebraic and analytic sides of E. This comparison morphism works uniformly for all ranks, and its construction depends on the choice of adelic determinant line L_A(E) and torsion regulators on the algebraic side.
I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
