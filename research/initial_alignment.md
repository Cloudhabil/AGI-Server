## Initial Alignment (Healthcare Discovery with ASI-OS)

If I’m a pro-human healthcare professional with access to all public medical data, my curiosity isn’t “more data”—it’s removing bottlenecks that kill, harm, or make lives chronically worse because evidence isn’t reaching practice. These are the decision-oriented questions to drive ASI-OS:

### 1) What treatments actually work in the real world?
- Trial efficacy vs. real-world impact (adherence, comorbidities, dosage, interactions, socioeconomics)
- Non-obvious combinations that help multi-morbidity patients
- Outdated guidelines vs. recent robust evidence

### 2) Early warning: risks and adverse effects
- Pharmacovigilance patterns before scandals
- Underestimated drug–drug/drug–supplement interactions
- Hidden risk in subpopulations (age, sex, genetics, comorbidities, context)

### 3) Late diagnosis: system errors
- Chronically late-diagnosed diseases (cancers, autoimmune, rare): missed early signals
- Referral pathways that fail (where the patient is lost)
- Minor symptom sequences that predict major events

### 4) Precision medicine without hype
- Biomarkers with strong evidence vs. marketing
- Where genetics adds clinical value today (and where not)
- Disease subtypes mislabeled as one diagnosis

### 5) Clinical trials: faster without breaking science
- Shorter/cheaper designs (adaptive/platform/surrogates) while preserving causality
- Underrepresented populations and bias
- Futility signals to stop failing trials early

### 6) Antibiotics and resistance
- Prescribing patterns → regional resistance
- Incubator hospitals/areas driven by usage dynamics
- Stewardship strategies that work by context

### 7) Public health as engineering
- Most cost-effective interventions by country/segment (vaccines, screening, smoking, obesity)
- Outbreak/burden predictors from public signals (weather, mobility, wastewater, searches)
- Early detection of medical misinformation as epidemiology

### 8) Inequities: the silent punishment
- Outcomes driven by postal code > diagnosis
- Access gaps (wait lists, specialists, cost adherence)
- Local policies that measurably reduce inequity vs. feel-good PR

### 9) Mental health
- Signals before crises (care patterns, dropouts, comorbidities) without invading privacy
- Effective therapies/combinations per profile and phase
- Reducing abandonment (the real enemy)

### 10) Aging and chronicity
- Interventions that delay frailty/dependency with robust evidence
- Patterns predicting falls, cognitive decline, rehospitalization
- Polypharmacy optimization in older adults

### 11) Healthcare costs (Fin-Ops of medicine)
- Low-value care: cost without outcome benefit (where, exactly)
- Operational changes that cut readmissions (triage, remote monitoring, coordination)
- Supply/purchase vulnerabilities and mitigations

### 12) Reproducibility and noise
- Fragile evidence (p-hacking, bias, small n) needing replication
- Contradictions driven by definitions, not biology
- Evidence maps: solid vs. probable vs. smoke

**Common pattern: decision-oriented curiosity**
- What to do differently tomorrow (clinical practice)
- What to prioritize this quarter (public health)
- What to fund/cut (R&D)
- What to monitor as risk (patient safety)
- Golden rule: provenance + traceability + limits (safety, licensing, ethics)
