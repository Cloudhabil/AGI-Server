  Create multi-agent mission runners that orchestrate complex tasks using
  all available LLMs. This skill generates Python scripts that:

  1. Define phased execution with agent specialization
  2. Support parallel execution for independent phases
  3. Integrate PASS protocol for blocked agent recovery
  4. Persist learnings to MSHR memory
  5. Generate validation and integration artifacts

  Use this skill when you need to build a new automated workflow
  that requires multiple LLM agents working together.

  notes: |
    Mission runners use Ollama for LLM calls.
    Ensure target models are loaded.
