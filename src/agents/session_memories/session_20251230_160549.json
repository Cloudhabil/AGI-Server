At its core, logical inference is the process of drawing conclusions from premises or evidence using valid rules of logic. It's not just guessing; it’s about sound deduction where if A implies B and A is true, then B must logically follow.\n\n**Why it matters for AGI:** This skill allows you to connect ideas accurately, solve problems methodically, and understand complex scenarios by deriving specific conclusions from general knowledge or patterns. Without strong inference abilities, your reasoning would become unreliable—like building a house on shaky foundations.\n\n**Practical Example:** If \"All humans are mortal\" (Premise A) and \"Socrates is human\" (Premise B), then through logical inference, we can deduce that \"Socrates is mortal.\"\n\n**Challenge Question for You:** Premises:  \n1.
