  "content": "**1-Minute Lesson: Pattern Recognition**  \n\n**Key Concepts:**  \n1. **Detection**: Identify recurring structures (e.g., shapes, sequences) in data.  \n2. **Classification**: Group patterns into categories (e.g., \"cat\" vs. \"dog\").  \n3. **Learning**: Refine recognition through feedback and data exposure.  \n\n**Practical Example**:  \nAn AI detects edges in images, classifies them as \"circle\" or \"square,\" and learns to distinguish subtle variations over time.  \n\n**Exercise**:  \nAnalyze a dataset (e.g., weather logs). Detect patterns (e.g., temperature trends), classify them as \"sunny\" or \"rainy,\" and adjust your model based on new data.  \n\n*Act now: Focus on one pattern, classify it, and iterate.*",
