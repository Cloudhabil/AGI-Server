The Riemann Hypothesis is about the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function, and it's conjectured that they all lie on the critical line with real part 1/2.\n\nI need to draw from quantum mechanics, specifically referencing Berry-Keating, RMT (Random Matrix Theory), and quantum chaos principles. Berry-Keating proposed a quantum mechanical system whose energy levels might correspond to the zeros of the zeta function. Their Hamiltonian involved a potential that grows like x^2 or something logarithmic, but it was related to the classical Hamiltonian for the system x d x / dt or something similar.\n\nThe Berry-Keating Hamiltonian is often given as H = p^2 /",
