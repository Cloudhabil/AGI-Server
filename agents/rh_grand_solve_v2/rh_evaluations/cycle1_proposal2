But there's an error message: \"HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=11434): Read timed out. (read timeout=120)\". This seems to be an error from an HTTP request, probably trying to fetch something from a local server, but it's timing out.\n\nI need to respond as the Reasoner for the GPIA ecosystem. My responsibilities include:\n\n- Deep resolution and forensic debugging only when explicitly invoked. Here, the error is part of the query, but it's not explicitly invoking me to debug it. The user is asking about the RH proof sketch, and the error might be a mistake or irrelevant.\n\n- Predictive pre-mortem for every plan. I should consider if this evaluation plan has potential failures.\n\n- Never invent tools; report missing requirements",
