It goes beyond just identifying words (like entity recognition) and focuses on what the user *wants to achieve*. Are they asking a question, making a request, expressing an opinion, or seeking information?\n\n2.  **Why it matters for",

It goes beyond simple keyword spotting to find structured pieces of information with defined categories.\n\n### Why it matters for AGI:\nThis is crucial because understanding real-world references requires pinpointing key concepts.

Humans effortlessly handle phrases like \"I banked the $500 check,\" (\"deposited\") or \"He is a good shot in the dark,\" (idiomatic, meaning he guesses).
