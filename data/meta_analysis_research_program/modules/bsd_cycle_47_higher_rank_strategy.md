# BSD Cycle 47: Higher Rank Strategy (Gap 6 Attack)

## Context

The BSD conjecture is a fundamental problem in number theory, aiming to describe the arithmetic of elliptic curves over number fields. The comparison morphism φ plays a crucial role in this context, as it provides a uniform framework for studying elliptic curves of all ranks. However, verifying that φ equals the BSD formula for rank ≥ 2 requires finding r independent generators, where r is the rank of the curve. This problem is notoriously difficult, and we will explore why.

## Why Rank ≥ 2 is Fundamentally Harder

The main challenge in dealing with rank ≥ 2 curves lies in the lack of a uniform approach to constructing higher-rank elliptic curves. Unlike rank 1 curves, which can be constructed using modular forms or Heegner's construction, there is no straightforward method for building higher-rank curves. This makes it difficult to develop a general strategy for verifying the BSD formula.

## Current Approaches: Higher Euler Systems and Heegner-Like Constructions

Several approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem:

* **Higher Euler systems**: These are algebraic structures that generalize classical Euler systems, which were used to construct rank 1 elliptic curves. However, higher Euler systems are much more complex and require a deeper understanding of their arithmetic properties.
* **Heegner-like constructions**: These methods aim to generalize Heegner's construction for rank 1 curves to higher ranks. While promising, these approaches face significant computational challenges.

## Computational Barriers: Finding Generators and Height Matrix Computation

The main computational barriers in verifying the BSD formula for rank ≥ 2 curves are:

* **Finding generators**: Identifying r independent generators is a challenging problem, especially when dealing with high-rank curves.
* **Height matrix computation**: Computing the height matrix of an elliptic curve over a number field is already a difficult task. For higher-rank curves, this becomes even more computationally intensive.

## Potential Strategies: Derived Intersection Theory and Spectral Methods

To overcome these challenges, we propose exploring:

* **Derived intersection theory**: This approach involves studying the derived functors of the intersection cohomology complex, which may provide new insights into the arithmetic of higher-rank curves.
* **Spectral methods**: These methods rely on analyzing the spectral properties of elliptic curves over number fields. By exploiting these properties, we might develop more efficient algorithms for verifying the BSD formula.

## What Would Constitute a Breakthrough

A breakthrough in this area would involve developing a general strategy for constructing higher-rank elliptic curves and verifying the BSD formula for rank ≥ 2. This could be achieved by:

* **Finding a uniform approach**: Developing a method that can construct higher-rank elliptic curves uniformly, without relying on specific constructions or heuristics.
* **Improving computational efficiency**: Finding ways to reduce the computational complexity of finding generators and computing height matrices for higher-rank curves.

To achieve this breakthrough, we must continue to push the boundaries of our understanding of arithmetic geometry and number theory.
