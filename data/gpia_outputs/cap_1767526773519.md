## Task

Write BSD Cycle 50: Final Synthesis and Research Roadmap

This is the FINAL cycle of the BSD Module. Synthesize everything.

CONTEXT:
- 50 cycles of BSD analysis complete
- Phase 1: Historical foundations (how we got here)
- Phase 2: Barrier analysis (what blocks us - turned to blueprints)
- Phase 3: Knowledge synthesis (what tools exist)
- Phase 4: Gap analysis (6 gaps identified, 3 bridged)
- Phase 5: Research directions (strategies for remaining gaps)

WRITE:
1. Executive summary: What we learned in 50 cycles
2. The Arithmetic Horizon H: Our proposed framework
3. Key insight: Barriers are blueprints, not walls
4. The comparison morphism phi: Wiring harness of H
5. Gap 6 (Higher Rank): The remaining monster
6. Recommended next steps for the research community
7. Connection to RH and unified Millennium approach

This is the capstone document. Make it comprehensive. Output markdown.
