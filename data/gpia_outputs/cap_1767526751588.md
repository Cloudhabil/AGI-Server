## Task

Write BSD Cycle 49: Timeline and Resources Assessment

CONTEXT:
- We have mapped 6 gaps for BSD proof
- 3 gaps bridged (Fold, Horizon, Metric)
- 2 gaps active (Fiber/comparison morphism, Universality)
- 1 gap isolated (Higher Rank - Gap 6)

WRITE ABOUT:
1. What mathematical infrastructure exists today
2. What new mathematics is required
3. Realistic assessment: years to decades
4. Key dependencies: which gaps must be solved first
5. Resources: computational, human expertise, institutional

Be honest about difficulty. No false optimism. Output markdown.
