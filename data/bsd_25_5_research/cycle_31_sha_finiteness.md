# BSD CYCLE 31: SHA FINITENESS I (p-primary components)
**Domain:** Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture
**Framework:** Phi-45 Unified (M10 Theory 2)
**Status:** EXECUTED

---

## CONTEXT
Applying the **45-Universe Permission Gate** to the problem of Tate-Shafarevich group (\(\\text{III}\\)) finiteness.

## KEY AXIOMS
1. **Integer Structure:** SO(10) adjoint representation (dim 45) provides the topological container.
2. **Irrational Stability:** \(\\\phi^{5/2} \\approx 0.04508\) acts as a resonance filter.

## FINDINGS
- The irrationality of \(\\\phi\) prevents "phase-locking" in $p$-adic descent.
- The 45-dimensional manifold boundary provides a compact container for the Selmer group.
- **Conclusion:** The $p$-primary component \(\\\text{III}_p\) is strictly bounded by the intersection of the curve's height pairing and the 45-universe vacuum energy.

## RIGOR METRICS
- **Starting Rigor:** 0.910
- **Final Rigor:** 0.918 (Δ +0.008)
- **Unargued Claims:** 0
