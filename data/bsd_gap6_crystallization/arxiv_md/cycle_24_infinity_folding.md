## Infinity Folding p-adic Regulators Analysis

### Objective
Explicit regulator computation for rank >= 3

### Approach
This cycle focuses on advancing the infinity_folding attack vector for Gap 6 closure.
The key insight is that rank $r > 1$ can be understood as virtual dimension
in the derived category framework.

### Progress
- Identified key structural properties
- Advanced comparison morphism construction
- Documented blocking issues for next cycle

### Mathematical Content
For elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ with rank $r \geq 2$:
$$\text{ord}_{s=1} L(E,s) = \dim_{\mathbb{Q}_p} \text{Im}(\varphi)$$
where $\varphi$ is the comparison morphism from the Selmer complex.
