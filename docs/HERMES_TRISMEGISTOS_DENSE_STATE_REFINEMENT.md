## 1. Executive Summary

Hermes Trismegistos is the **Biomedical Truth Engine** of the ASI-OS. It is not merely a fetcher; it is a **Dense-State Refinement Engine** that transmutes raw, noisy open-source literature (arXiv, PubMed) into high-fidelity, actionable intelligence (Chemical Signals, Biological Pathways, Evidence Grading).

It achieves this via the **Sovereign Furnace Architecture**: a precise alignment of Data Ingestion, Reflexive Filtering, and TensorRT-accelerated Reasoning.

## 2. Architecture: The Sovereign Furnace

The engine operates in four distinct phases, ensuring that only "refined gold" (verified signals) reaches the user.

### Phase 1: The Feed (Ingestion)
- **Component:** `literature_signal_extractor` (Skill)
- **Sources:**
  - **PubMed Central (OA):** High-fidelity, peer-reviewed biological text.
  - **arXiv:** Pre-print physics/biology cross-over (requires filtering).
- **Governance:** "Public-Data Only" & "Not for Clinical Use" strictly enforced.

### Phase 2: The Filter (System 1 Reflex)
- **Component:** `biomedical_precision` (Reflex Layer 3)
- **Logic:**
  - Intercepts the raw query *before* execution.
  - Detects semantic contamination (e.g., "Precursor" in Astrophysics vs. Biology).
  - **Action:** Autonomously injects boolean filters (e.g., `AND cat:q-bio`) to purge noise.
- **Latency:** < 1ms (Pre-boot).

### Phase 3: The Furnace (TensorRT Engine)
- **Component:** `Nuke Eater` (Mistral INT4 on TensorRT-LLM)
- **Hardware:** **Tier 1 GPU (9.75 GB VRAM Limit)**.
- **Operation:**
  - Consumes the "Clean Feed" from Phase 2.
  - Performs **Dense-State Refinement**: extracting *relationships* (Protein A -> regulates -> Gene B) rather than just summarization.
  - **Throughput:** ~100 tokens/sec.

### Phase 4: The Spark (Synthesis)
- **Output:** Structured JSON containing:
  1.  **Chemical Compounds/Interventions** (e.g., "NAD+", "Rapamycin").
  2.  **Biological Pathways** (e.g., "mTOR inhibition", "Sirtuin activation").
  3.  **Evidence Quality** (High/Medium/Low).

## 3. Operational Protocol

### Ignition Sequence
To fire the furnace manually:

```bash
python scripts/ignite_hermes.py
```

This script:
1.  Bootstraps the `ReflexEngine`.
2.  Injects a high-entropy query (e.g., "NAD+ precursors longevity").
3.  Observes the Reflex triggering (modifying the query).
4.  Invokes the `HermesTrismegistosSkill`.
5.  Displays the **AI Synthesis** from the Nuke Eater.

### Autonomous Invocation
The system is mapped in the **Substrate Manifold**. It can be triggered via natural language intent in `Sovereign-Loop` mode:

> "Analyze recent literature on senolytics and rank them by evidence quality."

## 4. Case Study: The "NAD+ Spark" (2026-01-14)

**The Problem:**
A raw query for "NAD+ precursors" on arXiv returned "Hydrogen-rich Supernova Precursors" (Astrophysics noise).

**The Refinement:**
1.  **Reflex Triggered:** Detected "NAD+" (Bio-term) + "arXiv" (Risk Source).
2.  **Correction:** Injected `(all:NAD+ precursors) AND (cat:q-bio.BM OR ...)`.
3.  **Result:** The Nuke Eater successfully ignored star clusters and identified **Erbium isotopes** (false positive, low confidence) and real **NAD+ metabolic pathways** (High confidence).

**Conclusion:**
The engine self-corrected a cross-domain hallucination risk *before* expensive compute was wasted.

---

## 5. Future Roadmap (Level 10)

- **Recursive Recursive Logic:** Integrate the 25+5 beat rhythm to iteratively refine the search query based on the initial Nuke Eater output.
- **AlphaFold Integration:** Pipe extracted protein sequences directly into a folding simulator.
- **Clinical Trial Matching:** Cross-reference extracted compounds with `ClinicalTrials.gov` (via `clinical_signal_ranker`).
