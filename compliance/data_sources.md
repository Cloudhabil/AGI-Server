# Data Sources & Copyright Statement (Draft)

Status: owner defaults; update if custom training/finetuning occurs.

## Statement
- Training data sources for GPIA/GPAI model: not shipped. Use only license-compliant, openly licensed datasets or Ollama-provided open-weight models. If custom training occurs, document dataset names, licenses, and any copyrighted materials with legal basis.
- Finetuning/adapters: if used, list datasets, licenses, and preprocessing steps.
- Third-party content: declare sources and rights (code/text/media) and ensure permissions.

## Required Actions
- If custom training/finetuning occurs, provide “sufficiently detailed” description of training data and licenses.
- If copyrighted material is used, document the legal basis (license, permission, or exception).
- Add any data exclusion lists or safety filters used during preprocessing.
