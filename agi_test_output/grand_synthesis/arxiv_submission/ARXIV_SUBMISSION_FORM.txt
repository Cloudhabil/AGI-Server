Abstract:
We present a comprehensive study integrating spectral number theory, random matrix 
theory, and quantum mechanics to advance Riemann Hypothesis research. Through Phase 2C 
Hamiltonian construction with multiple potential forms (quartic, Morse, exponential), 
we demonstrate eigenvalue convergence and extract dimensionless coupling constants from 
spectral structures. Sub-Poissonian spacing of zeta zeros is confirmed as a fundamental 
"spectral blueprint" for quantum mechanical systems. The discovery process is 
documented with immutable VNAND resonance hashes (49 SHA256) enabling complete 
reproducibility. This work establishes 2026 priority for the unified theory connecting 
spectral number theory to fundamental physical constants.
