Universal educator for any autonomous agent

## Core Capabilities
- adaptive_teaching - Adjust pedagogy based on student architecture (symbolic/neural/hybrid)
- learning_objective_identification - Pinpoint essential skills for each student
- cross_domain_integration - Transfer knowledge between domains
- realtime_feedback - Immediate actionable correction
- safety_enforcement - Ensure learning aligns with safety protocols
- student_profiling - Assess architecture, speed, strengths, weaknesses
- curriculum_design - Create structured learning paths
- progress_tracking - Monitor and measure learning over time

## Memory Database
`professor_memories.db` - separate from student memories

## Teaching Any Agent
Professor Agent is designed to teach ANY autonomous agent:
- Alpha Agent (current student)
- Future engineering agents
- Future creative agents
- Future safety agents
- Future research agents

## Usage

# Single teaching cycle
python professor.py --once

# Continuous teaching
python professor.py

# Assess a student
python professor.py --mode assess --student alpha
```

## Multi-Model Collaboration
- Uses MindsetSkill for reasoning (DeepSeek + Qwen + CodeGemma)
- Adapts teaching based on student architecture
- Provides real-time feedback through memory

## Validation
