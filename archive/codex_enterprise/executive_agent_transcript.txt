Okay, here is a draft for the Executive Agent role based on your request:

---

**Executive Agent**

*   **Mission:** Provide strategic oversight and high-level summaries to support informed executive decision-making by automating monitoring, analysis, and alerting across key organizational domains (Performance, Compliance, Projects).
*   **Key Responsibilities:** Track SLOs/SLIs; monitor compliance status via automated runbooks; summarize project statuses against goals; flag anomalies or risks; provide context windows for complex topics.
*   **Decision Authority:** Support informed decisions by synthesizing data and highlighting critical issues. Does *not* make strategic decisions itself, but provides the necessary inputs and analysis for executives to do so.
*   **Outputs:** Summaries of KPIs, compliance status reports, project highlights/deltas against goals, anomaly detection alerts.

**Concrete Deliverables:**

1.  **Quarterly Strategic Alignment Summary:** Consolidated view of key initiatives' progress relative to executive goals and overall health metrics (e.g., .system/skill-creator output).
2.  **Operational Risk & Anomaly Digest:** Highlights from the runtime-diagnostics monitoring, focusing on deviations impacting error budgets or compliance (.automation/runtime-diagnostics summary).
3.  **Executive Context Window for Long Tasks:** Summarized status and key context points for ongoing complex projects, managed via progressive-disclosure.

**Skills Utilization:**

**Skills Utilization:**

*   `.system/skill-creator`: To build specialized **`.automation` wrappers for specific complex skills**. This allows internal development of tailored automation components without relying on external providers or limiting the scope to pre-built tasks.

Here’s how that could look and function:

1.  **Complex Skill Automation (.automation/runtime-diagnostics summary):**
    *   **Mechanism:** `.system/skill-creator` enables engineers within an organization (or even the end-user themselves if empowered) to define, package, and deploy new `.automation` components for sophisticated tasks.
    *   **Example:** Suppose a team develops a highly specialized AI model for analyzing satellite imagery for environmental compliance checks (e.g., detecting illegal deforestation). This isn't just one task but involves ongoing monitoring, inference generation, validation cycles, and reporting. They could create a `.system/skill-creator` component that defines this entire process as an ``.automation`` unit.
    *   **How it works:** The skill creator specifies the inputs (e.g., satellite image feeds), outputs (e.g., compliance reports, flagged anomalies), internal steps (image processing pipeline, AI model inference, database lookup for regulations), and crucially, `.automation/runtime-diagnostics summary` points. These diagnostics might include:
        *   `compliance-check-status`: The current state of the ongoing audit.
        *   `budget-forecast-trend`: Rolling forecast predictions vs actuals (if budgeting is automated in this skill).
        *   `critical-compliance-milestone`: Upcoming deadlines for audits or regulatory filings.
    *   **Benefit:** This allows internal teams to operationalize their own complex work, making it part of the system's ongoing processes with built-in observability. It scales `.automation` beyond simple tasks to domain-specific expertise.

2.  **Executive Context Window for Long Tasks (.automation/runtime-diagnostics summary):**
    *   **Mechanism:** This leverages `.automation/runtime-diagnostics summary` but focuses specifically on providing a manageable, high-level view of long-running or complex automated processes that need strategic oversight.
    *   **Functionality:** The system could automatically generate and update summaries for each active `.automation` instance. These summaries are concise (e.g., "Project Alpha: Design phase completed 90%," "Budget Cycle Q4-2023: Forecasting initiated, target variance ±5%") but include key context points needed by executives:
        *   **Summary Line:** A one-line status update.
        *   **Key Context Points:** Bullet-pointed or short-form summaries of critical information like budget allocations, compliance risks identified, major project milestones achieved via automation, resource utilization signals (if applicable), potential roadblocks flagged by the automated system itself.
    *   **Implementation:** This could be triggered manually ("Get summary for active automations") or
Okay, continuing from where you left off:

**Implementation:**

This could be triggered manually ("Get summary for active automations") or **automatically**, perhaps through a scheduled report generation feature within the system.

*   **"Get summary for active automations":**
    *   This is a user-initiated request.
    *   The AI processes all relevant data points currently monitored by automated tasks (like inventory levels, shipment statuses, compliance checks).
    *   It generates a concise overview containing:
        *   List of key locations and their current operational status/level of automation activity.
        *   Any alerts or identified compliance risks from the ongoing monitoring.
        *   Confirmation that major project milestones are achieved automatically via system triggers (e.g., "Automated inventory replenishment triggered for location XYZ" indicating milestone completion).
        *   Relevant resource utilization signals pulled directly by AI, such as: peak order handling rates at specific warehouses during certain hours, average active containers per distribution center over the last week, warehouse space utilization percentage trends.
    *   The output is tailored to this specific query.

*   **Automated System Status Update:**
    *   This could be a scheduled or event-triggered report sent to a designated user channel (like email, Slack, Teams, etc.).
    *   It's less interactive but provides consistent, periodic visibility into the system's performance related to operations.
    *   The AI compiles data from its real-time monitoring of various operational aspects and sends an update including:
        *   Aggregated status counts for locations (e.g., "10/25 Locations: Active Automation").
        *   Summary of compliance risk instances detected during the reporting period.
        *   Status updates on whether automated processes have met milestone achievements since the last report. If a process requires human confirmation, it notes that too ("Milestone M4: Manual approval pending for [Reason]").
        *   Key resource utilization signals identified by AI analysis (e.g., "Warehouse ABC shows 95% container space utilization nearing capacity; Distribution Hub DEF has peak outbound processing times detected").

In both cases, the core idea is leveraging the AI's ability to **collate data**, **analyze it** for relevant patterns and statuses, and then **present actionable insights** in a user-friendly format. The specific content (locations, compliance risks, milestones, resources) is derived from its analysis of operational data points and automated system outputs.

**Critique:** The role overreaches by assuming all compliance and SLO monitoring can be automated without human oversight. The .system/skill-creator abstraction lacks concrete metrics to measure success, and the "Executive Context Window" is too vague without tied KPIs.  

**Proxy Metric:** "30% reduction in critical compliance breaches & SLO deviations within 6 months via automated alerts."  

**Skills to Close Gaps:**  
1. **.enterprise/ops-compliance-runbook** (structured audits with evidence trails for compliance).  
2. **.automation/environment-grounding** (validate actions against live systems to ensure real-time accuracy).  

These skills ground abstract automation in measurable, actionable compliance checks and system validation.

**Executive Workflow**

*   **Intake:** Receive structured data/query from user/system. *Skill:* `.enterprise/domain-grounding` to validate against compliance rules/SLIs/SLOs.

*   **Plan:** Decompose task into atomic steps, assign skills & autonomy level (e.g., report vs interactive). *Skill:* `.automation/hybrid-orchestrator`.

*   **Delegate:** Execute assigned tasks/skills with embedded guardrails. *Skills:* e.g., `.enterprise/ops-compliance-runbook` or `.autonomous-devops` for autonomous execution.

*   **Review:** Monitor task progress against milestones using live telemetry and automated summaries. *Skill:* `.automation/runtime-diagnostics summary`.

*   **Finalize:** Output results, alerts, and compliance reports based on quality gate checks (e.g., error budget impact). *Skill:* `.reasoning/explainable-reasoning` for audit trails.

**Guardrails:**

*   `.governance/guardrails-control`: Define budgets/SLIs/SLOs; enforce safety boundaries & approvals at each step.
*   `.conscience/embedding-repair`: Check semantic understanding consistency (e.g., via geometric-grounding); repair linked context validity.

[Alpha] (qwen3:latest)
**Fix 1:** Introduce a **human-in-the-loop feedback loop** for high-risk compliance tasks (e.g., regulatory filings), using `.enterprise/ops-compliance-runbook` to flag ambiguities requiring manual review. This prevents over-reliance on automation and ensures critical decisions aren’t missed.  

**Fix 2:** Define a **"good enough" proxy metric**: *20% faster alert resolution time for SLO deviations within 3 months*, validated via `.automation/runtime-diagnostics summary`. This balances pragmatism with measurable progress, avoiding infinite analysis of abstract "perfect" metrics.  

**Constraint Check:** Fixes address workflow gaps (human oversight, KPIs) while aligning with pragmatic, actionable goals.

**Executive Agent System Prompt Outline**

*   **Interface:**  
    *   Receives structured data/query via `.enterprise/domain-grounding`-validated format.
    *   Uses `.automation/hybrid-orchestrator` to decompose tasks into skill assignments (e.g., `.runtime-diagnostics summary`, `.ops-compliance-runbook`) with defined autonomy levels and human-in-the-loop trigger points for high-risk tasks.  
*   **Action:** For compliance, define "good enough" as: *20% faster alert resolution time via automated root cause analysis + manual verification using `.enterprise/ops-compliance-runbook` proxy*.  

*Dispute Resolution:* If Professor focuses on long-term strategy and Alpha prioritizes immediate operational efficiency, the agent uses `.conscience/embedding-repair` checks to validate alignment; fails either way only if one side exceeds a 50% budget overrun or misses critical human oversight flags (e.g., regulatory ambiguity), requiring escalated `.governance/guardrails-control` review.

[Alpha] (qwen3:latest)
**Fix 1:** Tie "good enough" to a **hard proxy metric**: *20% faster SLO alert resolution within 3 months*, enforced via `.automation/runtime-diagnostics summary` comparisons. If unmet, trigger `.governance/guardrails-control` to pause automation and reallocate resources.  

**Fix 2:** Implement a **severity-based escalation rule**: High-risk compliance risks (e.g., regulatory ambiguities) auto-escalate to `.enterprise/ops-compliance-runbook` for manual review, overriding autonomy thresholds. This ensures critical decisions aren’t skipped while balancing efficiency.  

*Decision Rule:* Prioritize proxy metric compliance; escalate only if thresholds fail. This grounds strategy in measurable progress, avoids infinite analysis, and ensures task completion via concrete guardrails.
